# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Updated toggle shortcuts from `Ctrl+A`/`Ctrl+E` to `Shift+A`/`Shift+E` for better cross-platform compatibility (Windows compatibility fix).

### Fixed
- **Single Selection Mode**: Fixed directories being selectable in single selection mode. Directories now display with circle (‚óã) indicators and cannot be selected, ensuring only leaf nodes (files) are selectable.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated to `@clack/core@1.0.0-alpha.1` and `@clack/prompts@1.0.0-alpha.1` for improved compatibility and performance.
- **Cancellation Handling**: Removed custom cancel symbol handling to use Clack's built-in `isCancel` function, fixing symbol display issues.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed debug code and test artifacts for cleaner codebase.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved hanging issue caused by mixing CommonJS `require()` with ES modules in cancel handler. Prompt now properly displays interactive tree interface and responds to user input.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **Demo Enhancement**: Replaced asciinema link with inline animated GIF for better GitHub README experience. Demo now plays directly in the README instead of redirecting to external site.
